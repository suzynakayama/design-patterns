# FACTORY Design Principle

We use this design pattern for wholesale object creation, so we outsource the process of initializing the object.

We can use:
- Separate method (Factory Method)
- Separate class (Full Factory Method)
- Create a hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory Method

A factory is a component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
